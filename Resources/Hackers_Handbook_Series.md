#  Hackers Handbook Series
This list comes from my own journey and struggles in the cybersecurity world. Over the years, I’ve searched for resources that truly help me understand and grow in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and red teaming. Each book on this list has played a crucial role in shaping my knowledge and skills, and I created this collection to share what I’ve learned the hard way. Whether you’re starting from scratch or looking to level up your expertise, these books are the ones that have helped me push past obstacles and deepen my understanding of the craft. I hope they do the same for you.
